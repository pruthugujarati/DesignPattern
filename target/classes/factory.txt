1.) What is Design Pattern?
--> A design patterns are well-proved solution for solving the specific problem/task.
   It provides a general reusable solution for the common problems 
   that occur in software design. The pattern typically shows relationships and 
   interactions between classes or objects. The idea is to speed up the development
   process by providing well-tested, proven development/design paradigms.

2.)what are the main type of design patterns?
-->Basically, Design patterns are categorized into 2 parts:
  1. Core Java Design Patterns
  2. JEE Design Patterns

--> Core Java Design Patterns :
    1. Creational Design Pattern
       i. Factory Pattern
       ii. Abstract Factory Pattern
       iii. Singleton Pattern
       iv. Prototype Pattern
       v. Builder Pattern.
   
    2. Structural Design Pattern
	i. Adapter Pattern
	ii. Bridge Pattern
	iii. Composite Pattern
	iv. Decorator Pattern
	v. Facade Pattern
	vi. Flyweight Pattern
	vii. Proxy Pattern

    3. Behavioral Design Pattern
	i. Chain Of Responsibility Pattern
	ii. Command Pattern
	iii. Interpreter Pattern
	iv. Iterator Pattern
	v. Mediator Pattern
	vi. Memento Pattern
	vii. Observer Pattern
	viii. State Pattern
	ix. Strategy Pattern
	x. Template Pattern
	xi. Visitor Pattern

3.)What is Factory Pattern?
-->A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the
   subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.
   The Factory Method Pattern is also known as Virtual Constructor.

4.)What is Abstract Factory Pattern?
-->Abstract Factory Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating families of related (or dependent) objects but 
   without specifying their concrete sub-classes.That means Abstract Factory lets a class returns a factory of classes. So, this is the reason
   that Abstract Factory Pattern is one level higher than the Factory Pattern.
   An Abstract Factory Pattern is also known as Kit.
